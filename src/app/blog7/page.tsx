                Before you even start planning the 2022 marketing strategy you
                need to conduct a SWOT analysis for your food and beverage
                business so that you have an idea of the status of your company.

              <p className="text-black text-lg font-semibold">
                Every marketing plan should have a clear objective that is
                specific, measurable, and achievable. Once you conduct a SWOT
                analysis and identify the areas where you need to make
                improvements in your business, create an objective statement for
                yourself.

              3. Develop a Target Audience Profile
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black text-lg mt-5">
              A lot of work goes into developing a target audience profile. The
              reason behind developing a target audience profile is to ensure
              that your marketing strategy is successful and you are able to
              target the right audience for each product or service that you
              develop in the future.
            </p>
            <p className="text-black text-lg mt-8">
              A target audience profile can be developed in many ways. One way
              is to look at the characteristics of a person who bought a product
              or service in the past and find out if they are likely to buy that
              product or service again.

              Determine the market share for each of your products or services
