              A website is a must if you own a restaurant and want to create a
              digital identity for your business. A website is important to
              interact with customers and attract potential customers through
              the website. Therefore, the website for any restaurant needs to be
              interactive. However, there are so many different website
              platforms that it becomes difficult to choose a feature-rich
              platform that provides you with all the features. One of the two
              most popular platforms for a restaurant website is HTML and
              WordPress, and people are usually confused between the two. Both
              types of websites have their advantage, but which is best for a
              restaurant? Let’s find out.
