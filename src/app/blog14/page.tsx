                Tweets with photographs enhance retweets by an average of 35
                percent. Please remember to keep the messages under the limit

                Facebook’s algorithm favors short text postings, which implies
                that they appear more frequently. However, the algorithm can
                change and you will have the ability to influence your
                audience’s interaction with Facebook posts with less language.
